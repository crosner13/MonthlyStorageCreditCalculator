    "This calculator assumes that hosted feature layer __views__ are assigned a storage cost of 0 credits. This is because technically, Esri does not charge for the hosting of feature layer views, since the underlying data actually belongs to the hosted feature layer from which the view was created. The views have a size of 0 Bytes, but the ArcGIS API for Python functions read the hosted feature layer's attachments as if they belong to the view (which they don't). This was leading to wildly inaccurate and even \"negative\" credit consumption for individual items and users. \n",
